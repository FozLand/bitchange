==> Some updates make changes in the 'config.default.txt', 
		check for changes when updating!

==> Why is it not working?
	-> Delete old 'config.txt'
	-> Copy 'config.default.txt' to 'config.txt' and edit it
	-> Try again
	-> Report bug if it still exists

==> How to ...
	-> Enable something: Open 'config.txt' with your editor and modify it
	-> See crafts: get an extention for your inventory or browse through the codes

==> Add special access to nodes, how?
	-> Exchange shop: open 'shop.lua' and edit the function 'has_exchange_shop_privilege',
		return 'true' to grant access to the contents, return 'false' to disallow
	-> Warehouse: same like exchange shop, this time 'warehouse.lua' and 'has_locked_chest_privilege'
	-> Bank: edit your "config.txt" and say "/giveme bitchange:bank" (without quotes)
	-> Access to protected: server or bitchange ("/grant player bitchange")
	
==> Can I ...
	-> Suggest things: Sure, I'm happy about (almost) every suggestion, just I'm pretty new, which
		means I can't realize all of them
	-> Report a fault: I hope this will not happen too much, post it at the topic in the MT forums
	-> Edit the files: Yes sure, the license is 'WTFPL' but I'm always happy about credits
	-> Delete this mod: Stupid question
	-> Exchange textures: Yes, it's WFTPL!

==> Give me informations about the converting!
